                            Down Syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder characterized by an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is one of the most common genetic conditions, occurring in approximately 1 in 700 births worldwide. Down Syndrome leads to developmental delays, intellectual disability, and distinct physical features such as slanted eyes, low muscle tone, and a flat facial profile. Additionally, individuals with Down Syndrome may have certain health conditions, including heart defects, hearing loss, and gastrointestinal issues. Early intervention programs, specialized medical care, and support services can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with Down Syndrome and their families.

                        Down Syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is one of the most common genetic conditions, affecting approximately 1 in 700 births worldwide. Down Syndrome leads to a range of physical and cognitive challenges, including developmental delays, intellectual disability, and distinct facial features such as almond-shaped eyes and a flattened facial profile.
                        Individuals with Down Syndrome may also experience various health issues, including heart defects, gastrointestinal problems, and hearing loss. However, advances in medical care and early intervention programs have significantly improved outcomes and quality of life for individuals with Down Syndrome.
                        Diagnosis of Down Syndrome typically involves prenatal screening tests and confirmation through genetic testing after birth. Early intervention services, including speech therapy, occupational therapy, and educational support, are crucial for addressing developmental delays and maximizing the potential of children with Down Syndrome.
                        Despite the challenges associated with Down Syndrome, individuals with this condition can lead fulfilling lives and make meaningful contributions to their families and communities. It's essential to provide inclusive and supportive environments that empower individuals with Down Syndrome to thrive and reach their full potential.

                        Down Syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. This additional genetic material affects the development and function of various organs and systems in the body.
                        The pathophysiology of Down Syndrome involves complex interactions between genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. The presence of the extra chromosome 21 disrupts normal cellular processes, leading to structural and functional abnormalities.
                        One of the key features of Down Syndrome is developmental delays and intellectual disability, which result from altered brain development. Individuals with Down Syndrome often have differences in brain structure and connectivity, including changes in the size and organization of certain brain regions.
                        Abnormalities in neuronal migration, synaptic function, and neurotransmitter signaling pathways have been observed in individuals with Down Syndrome. These alterations may contribute to cognitive impairments, learning difficulties, and other neurological manifestations associated with the condition.
                        Down Syndrome is also associated with various medical issues, including congenital heart defects, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and increased susceptibility to infections. These health complications arise from disruptions in organ development and function due to the presence of the extra chromosome.
                        While the exact mechanisms underlying Down Syndrome are not fully understood, ongoing research aims to elucidate the pathophysiological pathways involved. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing targeted interventions and improving outcomes for individuals with Down Syndrome.

                                Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is typically diagnosed through prenatal screening tests or after birth based on physical characteristics and genetic testing. Prenatal screening tests, such as maternal serum screening and ultrasound, can indicate an increased risk of Down syndrome. If these tests suggest a higher risk, diagnostic tests such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis can be performed to confirm the diagnosis by analyzing fetal cells for chromosomal abnormalities.
                                After birth, doctors may suspect Down syndrome based on characteristic physical features, such as almond-shaped eyes, a flattened facial profile, and a single deep crease across the palm. Genetic testing, usually through a blood test called karyotyping, is then conducted to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the presence of an extra chromosome 21.
